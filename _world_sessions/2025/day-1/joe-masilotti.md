Building native mobile apps is time-consuming and expensive. Each screen must be built three times: once for web, again for iOS, and a third time for Android.

But with Hotwire Native, you only need to build your screens once, in HTML and CSS, and then reuse them across all three platforms. If you already have a Hotwire-enabled Rails app, you can use the screens you've already built!

And you don't need to be an expert in Swift or Kotlin. A thin wrapper for each platform enables continuous updates by only making changes to your Rails codebase. Deploy your code, and all three platforms get your changes immediately.

Join me as I build iOS and Android apps from scratch, live. Learn the essentials, practical tips, and common pitfalls I’ve picked up since working with Hotwire Native since 2016.
