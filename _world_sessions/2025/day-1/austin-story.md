Ditch vendor lock-in!

Doximity, like many mid-sized innovators, needed rapid iteration and cost-effective scale. We replaced a slow, expensive analytics vendor with a custom Rails pipeline, achieving 3k events/second scale with Rails.

Learn how Rails' integrated power—Kafka (Karafka), Action Cable for real-time debugging, and optimized request handling—enabled our small team to build a high-throughput system, slashing latency from hours to seconds and saving hundreds of thousands of dollars per year.

Learn how Rails’ conventions and ecosystem offer startup agility with enterprise-level performance, proving it’s the ideal toolkit for rapid growth and reclaiming control. See how your team can leverage Rails to conquer data challenges and achieve massive ROI.
