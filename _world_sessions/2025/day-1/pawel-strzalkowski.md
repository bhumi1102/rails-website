Remember the joy of Rails scaffold creating web interfaces in DHH’s demos? Let’s make it just as simple for AI integrations!

Imagine Rails scaffolding not just views for humans, but a parallel, AI interaction layer - out of the box!

How? By embracing convention over configuration with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), the emerging standard (backed by Google & OpenAI) for AI-app interactions.
Example: Scaffold a ReservationsController and instantly let an AI agent book a room via MCP - just like agents may use it with GitHub or JIRA today.

I’ll show:
- A full-stack AI-ready app scaffolded live
- An AI agent using it
- How backend, frontend, and AI layers cooperate
- How to make your app speak AI natively

Ultimately, this talk shows Rails’ competitive advantage for the AI era.
