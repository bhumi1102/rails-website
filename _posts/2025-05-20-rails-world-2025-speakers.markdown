The third edition of [Rails World](/world/2025) is fast approaching with only 107 more days to go, so it’s time to meet the speakers who will join us this year in Amsterdam. 

We had a _record_ number of speaker submissions this year, so **thank you** to everyone who applied. This lineup was ultimately selected for their unique technical viewpoints covering what is new in Rails, how to make the most of the framework today, and where Rails is headed in the future.

Here is our [2025 speaker lineup](/world/2025/speakers):
